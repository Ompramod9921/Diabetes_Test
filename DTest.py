One of every four people with diabetes doesn't know they have it. Are you at risk? Diabetes is a manageable condition, but left untreated it can cause serious harm. Try our quiz to see if you are showing any of the tell-tale signs.**")
    st.success('''Who is this quiz for ? >>>> If you're concerned that you might be experiencing some of the symptoms of diabetes, or know that you may be at risk of the condition, this quiz should help you discover whether you are exhibiting some of the symptoms and evaluate your risk . ''')
    st.warning('''Who is at risk ? >>>> Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition and as yet the triggers for this condition are unknown. However, type 2 diabetes has a number of risk factors, including being overweight or obese, living a sedentary lifestyle, or eating an unhealthy, high-calorie diet. "With type 2 diabetes your body's still producing at least some insulin (which helps our cells to utilise glucose) but you can't respond to it - you've lost that sensitivity. If the system gets overworked - eating the wrong things, eating too frequently, too much - the system gets worn out and we lose the sensitivity to it " , explains Dr Jenna Macciochi, Doctor of Immunology at the University of Sussex. ''')
    st.success('''Might I have diabetes and not realise ? >>>> With type 1 diabetes, the body stops producing insulin, meaning the effect on the body is usually rapid and noticeable. However, type 2 diabetes develops slowly - the body still produces insulin, but it may be insufficient, or the body might not respond to it properly. This means that the development of symptoms is gradual. "Symptoms for type 1 diabetes often develop very fast," explains Macciochi. "But with type 2 diabetes you may not even know you have it, as symptoms can be very subtle. ''')
    st.warning('''What does the test consist of ? >>>> The test consists of 15 questions, looking at symptoms you may have noticed. Using the data, you will then be given advice on whether to seek help. ''')
    st.success('''How accurate is it ? >>>> The only conclusive test for diabetes is a blood test. However, the quiz should give you an indication of whether to seek urgent help, or whether to raise the issue at your next GP appointment. ''')

The research, conducted by Marshall Govindan and Dr Emilia RipollBunn, also found that the direct stim ulation of the pancreas by certain postures rejuvenated its capacity to produce insulin.**")

As a result, more insulin is pushed into the system. This rejuvenates the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas of diabetics suffering from both type 1 and 2. Practising the postures in a relaxed manner, without exertion, meditation and breathing techniques help most patients control the triggers or causes of diabetes.**')
